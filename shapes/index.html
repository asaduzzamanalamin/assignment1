            <p class="work6">sakib al hasan Born in Magura, Khulna, Shakib started playing cricket at an early age. According to Prothom Alo sports editor Utpal Shuvro, Shakib "was fairly proficient at cricket and was often hired to play for different villages and teams".[10][11] In one of those matches, Shakib impressed an umpire who arranged for him to practice with the Islampur Para Club, a team in the Magura Cricket League. During the practice session, Shakib batted aggressively and bowled fast, as he usually did, but also chose to experiment with spin bowling which proved to be not so effective. He was picked to play for Islampur and took a wicket with his first ball; it was his first delivery with a proper cricket ball, having previously played with a taped tennis ball.[10][11] He spent six months training at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan,[10][11] a government-run sports institute.[12]</p>
