            <p class="work6">sakib al hasan Born in Magura, Khulna, Shakib started playing cricket at an early age. According to Prothom Alo sports editor Utpal Shuvro, Shakib "was fairly proficient at cricket and was often hired to play for different villages and teams".[10][11] In one of those matches, Shakib impressed an umpire who arranged for him to practice with the Islampur Para Club, a team in the Magura Cricket League. During the practice session, Shakib batted aggressively and bowled fast, as he usually did, but also chose to experiment with spin bowling which proved to be not so effective. He was picked to play for Islampur and took a wicket with his first ball; it was his first delivery with a proper cricket ball, having previously played with a taped tennis ball.[10][11] He spent six months training at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan,[10][11] a government-run sports institute.[12]</p>

His teammate Mashrafe Mortaza, who was bought in the auction by the Kolkata Knight Riders, said "I would have been a lot happier if Shakib had got a team because he truly deserved it for his sensational form with the bat and ball".</p>

          <p>The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Shakib the 'icon player' for Khulna Royal Bengals (KRB).[89] Under his captaincy, Shakib's team progressed to the semi-finals of the competition where they were beaten by Dhaka Gladiators despite Shakib's 86* off 41 balls.[90] In ten matches he scored 280 runs and took 15 wickets, which made him KRB's leading wicket-taker, and was named Man of the Tournament.[91][92]
